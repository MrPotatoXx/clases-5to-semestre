I remember a couple months ago I went with some friends to the beach and at a guess, we used the airbnb application. we found an apartment for forty thousand Chilean pesos per night, which seemed incredible but at the time of booking the manager raised the price too much, so we had to stay in the cabin of my friend's grandfather, at the time it was something overwhelming but luckily we did not have to spend too much on a place to stay.
